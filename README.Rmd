## Density Plot

The AssignmentB2 package provides an efficient way to create a density plot through the `density_plot` function. It creates a density plot with alpha=0.5 based on the given inputs, dataset, x, and fill values, using ggplot2. This package can be used as a visualization tool to represent the distribution of a continuous numeric variable (x) across multiple fills(categorical values).

## Installation

You can install the development version of Density Plot with the following instructions:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2023/assignment-b2-Weiya818")
```

## Example

This is an example showing how to generate the density plot using this package.

    ```{r}
library(AssignmentB2)
density_plot(data = datateachr::cancer_sample, x = datateachr::cancer_sample$radius_mean, fill = datateachr::cancer_sample$diagnosis, x_axis_name = "radius_mean")
    ```
